# Cs-405
	This class was a real eye opener to just how significant following correct security protocols really is when developing and maintaining programs. Even the smallest thing like an unsigned variable such as “int I” vs “int I = 0” creates a vulnerability that may cause an issue. Of course, I believe the bigger picture of this course is focused on avoiding and preventing malicious activity from affecting our programs. This was a great opening door to the real-world of software development. We will almost always be creating some software that is going to be used by someone who inherently trusts that program. If an end user is putting in their bank information into a program, it is our due diligence to ensure that we covered all bases of security measures, especially in implementing a Defense in Depth approach to our program and using over-lapping layers of security. 
From here on out, I will try to look at future projects and assignment from a security standpoint and refer to the great resources provided in this course to guide me on the best practices of proper writing. I will also implement this mindset as the program is being developed, not after the bulk of it is written. I’m excited to see how this is focused on in the professional sector.
